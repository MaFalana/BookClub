#  BookClub

## Description
Book Scanning application based on Yuka

### Features


### What I Learned

Using SwiftData with MVVM

UPC barcode.

ISBN (International Standard Book Number) barcode.

Using apple maps to serch for releevant locations

Delaying functions so that they run at a certain time

leverageing data from multiple apis together into one cohesive data model

A book cannot exist in multiple lists after starting an new app session -> Fixed it by Using a many to many relationship, Books can be long too many lists

### Problems, Issues and how I overcame them

## Current Bugs

When a book is added to a user generated list there is no checkmark indicting what list(s) it belongs to

Books in user generated lists are never in the same order after starting a new app session



## Future Improvements

Add sharing capablities

Book avalibitly near user using their current location

Book recommendations (recommendations based on the author may be the easiest to implement)

Using LibGen to download avlaible epub files and open them in Apple Books
